# AI PARENT 👩‍👦
Worked on this project with a team at HackPrinceton Fall 2023.<br>
AI Parent is a co-parent to kids with single mother/father. The software helps a parent/ guardian in children's growth and support. It bridges the gap by fostering emotional connections with them.<br>
We used CharacterAI to build the parent character in our project. We used Python to integrate the APIs and send it to the Swift UI app.<br><br>
